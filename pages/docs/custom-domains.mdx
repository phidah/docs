By default, all deployments are assigned a `.vercel.app` suffixed domain.

This domain can be replaced with a **Custom Domain** of your choice. This Custom Domain can be purchased with <OrgName /> or a third-party.

In this document, adding a domain to your <ProductName /> [projects](/docs/v2/platform/projects/) is explained in detail.

## Adding a Domain

If you don't own a domain yet, you can [purchase it with <OrgName />](/domains). Then, once you own a domain, adding it to a project is very straightforward:

### Step 1: Selecting Your Project

On the [dashboard](/dashboard), pick the project to which you would like to assign your domain:

<Caption>
  Selecting the project from the <OrgName /> Dashboard.
</Caption>

### Step 2: Navigating to Domain Settings

Once you have selected the project of your choice, click on the **Settings** tab:

  width={626 / 2}
  height={340 / 2}
  shadow
/>
<Caption>
  Selecting the <b>Settings</b> tab from the Project Overview page.
</Caption>

Then, select the **Domains** menu item:

  width={440 / 2}
  height={532 / 2}
  shadow
/>
<Caption>
  Selecting the <b>Domains</b> menu item from the Project Settings page.
</Caption>

### Step 3: Entering Your Chosen Domain

From the **Domains** page, enter the domain you wish to add to the project:

  width={1566 / 2}
  height={392 / 2}
  shadow
/>
<Caption>Entering a domain for the project from the Domains page.</Caption>

### Step 4: Configuring the Domain

Once the domain has been added, you will be presented with different methods for configuring it, depending on whether it is an [**apex domain**](/docs/platform/glossary#apex-domain) (example.com) or **subdomain** (docs.example.com).

**Apex domains** can be configured with a **A** record, while **subdomains** can be configured with a **CNAME** record.
Both domain types can also be configured using the **Nameservers** method.

#### Apex Domains

You can configure [apex domains](/docs/platform/glossary#apex-domain) either with a **A** record or through the **Nameservers** method.

#### Subdomains

You can configure subdomains either with a **CNAME** record or through the **Nameservers** method.

### Step 5: Domain Configured

Once the domain has been configured, the card status will change to reflect this.

## DNS Records

Once a Domain has been added, all of its DNS Records can be found in the Advanced Settings page.
From there, you can view and manage the records.

### Step 1: Selecting your Domain

On the [dashboard](/dashboard), click on the **Domains** tab:

<Image
  src={`${process.env.ASSETS}/docs/custom-domains/select-domains-tab-2.png`}
  width={982 / 2}
  height={732 / 2}
  shadow
/>
<Caption>
  Selecting the <b>Domains</b> tab from the <OrgName /> Dashboard page.
</Caption>

Once on the **Domains** tab, click on a Domain of your choice to view its Advanced Settings page.

  width={2158 / 2}
  height={978 / 2}
  shadow
/>
<Caption>Selecting the Domain to view its Advanced Settings page.</Caption>

### Step 2: Add DNS Record

Once on the Advanced Settings page of your Domain, fill out the DNS Record form and click on the **Add** button.

  width={2068 / 2}
  height={646 / 2}
  shadow

<Caption>DNS Records form to add a new DNS Record.</Caption>

Using the form mentioned above, you can then add the DNS Record of your choice. The following types are supported:

- `A`
- `AAAA`
- `ALIAS`
- `CAA`
- `CNAME`
- `MX`
- `SRV`
- `TXT`

## Wildcard Domains

You can use your custom domain as a Wildcard Domain by prefixing it with `*.`.

<Note type="warning">
  If using your custom domain as a Wildcard Domain, you{' '}
  <b>must use the nameservers method for verification</b>.
</Note>

To add a Wildcard Domain, follow the steps to [add a domain](#step-1:-selecting-your-project), the only change being; at [step 3](#step-3:-entering-your-chosen-domain), where you should instead use the prefix mentioned above, for example; `*.acme.com`.

  width={1496 / 2}
  height={232 / 2}
  shadow
/>
<Caption>

</Caption>

After the verification process is complete, the status of the domain will be updated within the UI to confirm that it is ready for use.

## Deploying with Your Domain

Once the domain has been added to your project and configured, it is **automatically applied to your latest deployment**.

<Note>
  The first deployment of a new project will be marked as production and
  subsequently assigned with your custom domain automatically.
</Note>

When a custom domain is assigned to a project with an enabled [<ProductName /> for Git Integration](/docs/git-integrations), each push (including merges) to the [Production Branch](/docs/git-integrations#production-branch) (commonly `main`) will trigger a deployment to the defined domain.

Reverts take effect immediately, assigning the custom domain to the deployment made prior to the point the revert is effective from.

## Redirecting Domains

You can add domain redirects from the **Domains** tab when **more than one domain** is present for the project. This provides a way to, for example, redirect a `www` subdomain to an apex domain but can be used in a variety of ways.

To add a redirect, click the **Edit** button for the domain you want to redirect from and use the **Redirect to** dropdown to select the domain you want to redirect to:

## Moving Domains

You can move domains to another profile or team using the **Domains** tab from the **<OrgName /> Dashboard**.

  width={1224 / 2}
  height={278 / 2}

<Caption>
  Selecting the <b>Domains</b> tab from the <OrgName /> Dashboard page.

Once on the **Domains** tab, select the domain(s) you wish to move by using the checkbox next to each domain then click **Move**.

<Caption>

After selecting the domain(s) and clicking **Move**, you will be asked to confirm which profile or team you wish to move them to.

  width={840 / 2}
  height={818 / 2}
  shadow

<Caption>Entering a new profile or team destination for a domain.</Caption>

When selecting the input field, you will be provided with a list of teams you belong to. If the profile or team you wish to move the domain(s) to is not present, enter the `slug` value instead. You can find the `slug` value in **Settings** page for both profiles and teams.

<Note type="warning">
  When moving domains to another team or profile, they will be removed from{' '}
  <b>all projects</b> they are currently part of.
</Note>

To confirm the change, select **Move**. The domains will be transferred to the new profile of team immediately.

## Assigning a Domain to a Git Branch

Every commit pushed to the [Production Branch](/docs/git-integrations#production-branch) of your Git repository using our [Git Integration](/docs/git-integrations) will be assigned the Domains [configured in your project](#adding-a-domain).

In order to automatically assign a Domain to a different branch, you can enter it in the **Git Branch** field of your Domain:

  width={1496 / 2}
  height={664 / 2}
  shadow

## Removing a Domain

To remove a domain that is assigned to a project, navigate to the **Domains** tab from the Project Overview and click the **Edit** button for the domain you want to remove:

## Provider Specific Instructions

### Cloudflare

To use [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)-managed domains, follow these steps:

1. Configure your domain such that SSL is disabled for the path `/.well-known/**`.
2. Run `curl http://<domain>/.well-known/acme-challenge` (Replace `<domain>` with your domain. Notice that it’s `http` and not `https`).

If the above `curl` command returns an error (e.g. `{"error":{...}}`), then you’re good to go - it means that <OrgName /> can generate certificates successfully. Otherwise, make sure that SSL is disabled for `/.well-known/**` and try again.
